To solve this, verify the following:

1. **Correct Installation:** Ensure the native module is installed correctly using npm or yarn. Check package.json for the correct dependency and its version.
2. **Linking:**  Most native modules require linking.  Follow the specific instructions provided by the module's documentation. This often involves using a command-line tool (react-native link or a similar package-specific command). 
3. **Android Configuration (if applicable):** For Android, check your `android/settings.gradle`, `android/app/build.gradle` and `android/app/src/main/java/[...]/MainActivity.java`  files. Confirm that the module's native components are correctly referenced.   
4. **iOS Configuration (if applicable):** For iOS, verify that the native module is correctly included in your Xcode project. Make sure the necessary framework is added and the bridging header is configured properly.
5. **Clean and Rebuild:**  After making changes, clean and rebuild your project in the React Native environment.  This can help resolve inconsistencies.
6. **Check Module Documentation:**  Refer to the module's official documentation for detailed installation and configuration instructions.
